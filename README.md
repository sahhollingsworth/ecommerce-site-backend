# E-Commerce Website Backend
This is a backend build in partnership with an pre-existing e-commerce site frontend.  Given the prevalence of ecommerce in retail trends and day-to-day life, understanding the fundamental architecture of e-commerce platforms is an important area of focus for full-stack web development.

This project leverages Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
